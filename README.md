This project uses [COSMIC](https://cosmic-popsynth.github.io/) for computer 
simulations.

The main description for the project comes from class:

"Black holes with masses below ∼ 100 M⊙ are predominantly expected to form from 
stars. This project will investigate how different assumptions for stellar 
evolution affects the masses of the black holes that can be produced from stars
by using the population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate single stars with 
different ZAMS masses and metallicities. COSMIC includes several models for 
compact object formation but actually doesn’t treat black holes different from 
neutron stars; your first task to study how COSMIC simulations compact object 
formation and articulate why black holes and neutron stars are handled the same 
way.

Next, you should investigate the boundaries (upper and lower) of the black hole 
mass spectrum and how those boundaries change with different assumptions in the 
code. How does the mass spectrum within the boundaries change? Compare your 
simulations to black holes discovered and characterized through microlensing, 
radial velocity and astrometry, X-rays, and gravitational waves. What can you 
conclude about the origin of black holes based on this comparison? As detectors 
increase their sensitivity to stellar populations that are far away, do you 
expect the majority of the black holes to have larger masses or smaller masses?"
